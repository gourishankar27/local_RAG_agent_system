      " In the provided context, there is no information about defining a custom agent for a specific task such as a game or a chatbot. However, if we are talking about a Neural Network model (like NBeats), here's how you might define a custom agent:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Identify the problem you want to solve with your custom agent. This could be anything from playing a game like chess or Go, to controlling a robot, to generating text in a chatbot.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. Choose an appropriate architecture for your model based on the problem you're trying to solve. For instance, if it's a sequence-to-sequence task like text generation, you might choose an LSTM or Transformer architecture. If it's a game with a large state space, you might consider using a deep reinforcement learning model.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. Prepare your dataset and labels for training the agent. This might involve collecting data from the environment, cleaning the data, and possibly preprocessing it in some way to make it suitable for the neural network.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. Train the model on your dataset using an appropriate loss function and optimizer. This might involve splitting your data into a training set and a validation set, and using techniques like cross-validation to ensure that your model is learning effectively from the data.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. Test your trained agent on new data to evaluate its performance. This could involve running simulations, playing games, or generating text. You'll want to measure some metrics of performance to determine how well your custom agent is doing compared to other possible solutions.\n",
      "\n",
      "6. Iterate on your model by fine-tuning hyperparameters, adding layers to the network, changing the loss function or optimizer, or collecting more data to improve its performance if necessary.\n",
      "\n",
      "This process can be complex and time-consuming, but with careful design and experimentation, it's possible to create a custom agent that is effective at solving the problem you've defined.\n",
